If you go away
On this summer day
Then you might as well
Take the sun awayAll the birds that flew
In the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were highWhen the day was young
And the night was long
And the moon stood still
For the night bird songIf you go away
If you go away
If you go awayBut if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be againWe'll sail on the sun
We'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees
And worship the windThen if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To hold in my handIf you go away
If you go away
If you go awayBut if you stay
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been
Or will be againI'll ride on you smile
I'll sail on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes
That I love so muchBut if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To hold in my handIf you go away
If you go away
If you go awayIf you go away
As I know you must
There'll be nothing left
In the world to trustJust an empty room
Full of empty space
Like the empty look
I see on your faceOh, I'd have been the
Shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might
Have kept me by your sideIf you go away
If you go away
If you go awayPlease, don't go away
