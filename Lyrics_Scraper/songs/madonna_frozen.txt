You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not openYou're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open
Mmm hmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm hmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm hmmm, give yourself to me
Mmm hmmm, you hold the keyNow there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be brokenLove is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open
Mmm hmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm hmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm hmmm, give yourself to me
Mmm hmmm, you hold the keyYou only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not openMmm hmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm hmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm hmmm, give yourself to me
Mmm hmmm, you hold the key
If I could melt your heart
Mmm hmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm hmmm, give yourself to me
Mmm hmmm, you hold the key
If I could melt your heart
