I can give you everything that you want
Bitch get off my pole, bitch get off my pole
You can't buy this at no luxury store
Bitch get off my pole, bitch get off my poleThere's a place you gotta go before I let you take it all
It's like a drug, it should be illegalBaby you should get down low
And drink my precious alcohol
You look so thirsty, I think you need itKiss it better, kiss it better (Don't it taste like holy water)
Make it wetter, make it wetter (Don't it taste like holy water)
Kiss it better, make it wetter (Don't it taste like holy water)
Kiss it better, kiss it betterI can't teach you all the things you don't know
Bitch get off my pole, bitch get off my pole
It's where like make it something you wanna own
Bitch get off my pole, bitch get off my poleThere's something you gotta hit
It's sacred and immaculate
I can let you in heaven's doorI promise you it's not a sin
Find salvation deep within
We can do it here on the floorKiss it better, kiss it better (Don't it taste like holy water)
Make it wetter, make it wetter (Don't it taste like holy water)
Kiss it better, make it wetter (Don't it taste like holy water)
