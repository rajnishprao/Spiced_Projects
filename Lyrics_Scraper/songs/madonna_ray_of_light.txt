Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of morning
Sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe, gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyoneAnd I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feelFaster than the speeding light, she's flying
Trying to remember
Where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when
Earth shall be as oneAnd I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feelQuicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of lightZephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning
Sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe, gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyone
And I feel...Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless yearsShe's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universeAnd I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feelQuicker than a ray of light
She's flying
Quicker than a ray of light
I'm flying
