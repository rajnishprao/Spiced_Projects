Baby
B-b-b-baby
Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like thisDon't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is realYou don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last no-noWhat you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come downDon't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is realLong stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bedYou deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your ownDon't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is realExpress yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey-hey-hey-heySo if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Oh, baby ready or notAnd when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his kneesTo express himself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey-heyDon't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
