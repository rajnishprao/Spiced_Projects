Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly(...)
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby, night and day
I'm fed upI'm tired of waiting for you.
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught upI don't know what to do
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowlyI don't know what to do
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby, night and day
I'm fed upI'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby, night and day
I'm fed upI'm tired of waiting on you
Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm doneI'm hanging up on you
I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me
'Cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one dayBut it'll be too late
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby, night and day
I'm fed upI'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing
Every little thing
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Waiting for your callI'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you
