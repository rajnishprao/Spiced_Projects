You're a copycat, get back
I'm always on your mind
Take a photograph like that
Always ahead of my timeI'll give you a heart attack, bumbaclat
Where is my Royalty?
You're a pretty girl, I'll give ya that
Stealing my recipeHere we go again, in your fantasy
You can try it all, but you can't be me
You can walk the walk, even talk the talk
But you always be two steps behind meIn my shadow, two steps behind me
Out of ammo, you're never gonna be
On my level, two steps behind me
In my shadow, you're just a wanna be meLike a sister all messed up
Who's gonna help you out?
It's an ugly look princess
What are you all about?Did you study me hard enough?
Trying to be a boss
Yeah that's cool and all get in line
Tickets are gonna costHere we go again, in your fantasy
You can try it all, but you can't be me
You can walk the walk, even talk the talk
But you always be two steps behind meIn my shadow, two steps behind me
Out of ammo, you're never gonna be
On my level, two steps behind me
In my shadow, you're just a wanna be meNever gonna be me
Just a wanna be me...Just a wanna be me
Never gonna be me
Just a wanna be me...Here we go again, in your fantasy
You can try it all, but you can't be me
You can walk the walk, even talk the talk
But you always be two steps behind meIn my shadow, two steps behind me
Out of ammo, you're never gonna be
On my level, two steps behind me
In my shadow, you're just a wanna be meNever gonna be me
Just a wanna be me...Just a wanna be me
Never gonna be me
Just a wanna be me...Just a wanna be me
