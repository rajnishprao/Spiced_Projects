It's not Jay Z and Beyonce
It's not Nicki or Lil Wayne
It's not Oprah and Obama
the Pope or Rihanna
Queen Elizabeth or Kanye
It's not pentagrams or witchcraft
It's not triangles or stacks of cash
Black magic or Gaga
Gucci or Prada
Riding on the golden calfThe all-seeing eye is watching tonight
That's what it is
Truth and light
The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide
Secrets insideIt's like everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party shining like IlluminatiIt's the enlightenment that started it all
The founding fathers wrote it down on the wall
And now the media's misleading us all
To right and to wrong
It's time to dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonightBehind the curtain of the New World Order
It's not platinum encrypted corners
It's not ISIS or the Phoenix, pyramids of Egypt
Don't make it into something sordid
It's not Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
It's not Google or the United States
It's not Bieber or LeBron
Clinton or a bomb
Or anyone you love to hateThe all-seeing eye is watching tonight
That's what it is
Truth and light
The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide
Secrets insideIt's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party, shining like IlluminatiYou know that everything that glitters isn't gold
So let the music take you out of control
It's time to feel it in your body and soul
C'mon, let's go
We're gonna dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonightIt's like...
It's like...
It's like everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
like everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
Everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
