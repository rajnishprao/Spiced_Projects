Hey
What?
Listen
I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
'Til you walked through my door
I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me, baby, this I know
'Cause it's true love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you
I've heard all the lines
I've cried, oh so many times
Those tear drops they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said
True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you
'Cause it's true love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you
No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love
It's true love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love
It's true, so if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said
No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that
It's true love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you
I love you
This time I know it's true love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits just like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love
It's true love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love
It's true love
