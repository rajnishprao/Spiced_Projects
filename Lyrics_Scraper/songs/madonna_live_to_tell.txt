I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wallA man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of meI know where beauty lives
I've seen it once
I know the warmth she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside you can't take that from me...A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me...The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?If I ran away
I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart...?
Will it grow cold?
(will it grow cold?)
The secret that I hide
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know...?A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me...The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again...?
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me...
