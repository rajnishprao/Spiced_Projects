There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that I wait, the more time that I wasteI havn't got much time to waste
It's time to make my way
I'm not afraid of what I'll face
But I'm afraid to stay
I'm going down my road and I can make it alone
I'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my ownAre you ready to jump
Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump
Just take my hand
get ready to jumpWe learned out lesson from the start
My sisters and me
The only thing you can depend onIs your family
Life's gonna drop you down like a limb from a tree
It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you seeAre you ready?There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that you wait
The more time that you wasteI'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my ownIt sways and it swings and it bends until you make it your ownI can make it alone (my sisters and me)
