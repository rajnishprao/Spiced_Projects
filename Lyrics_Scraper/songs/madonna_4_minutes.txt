I'm outta time and all I got is four minutes!Breakdown, come on
Come on, MadonnaCome on, boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll
Well, don't waste time
Give me desire, tell me how you wanna roll
I want somebody to speed it up for me, then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?If you want it, you've already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real, just
Say the word and I'mma give you what you wantTime is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy, then grab a girl
Time is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world
No hesitating
We only got four minutes, huh, four minutesSo keep it up, keep it up
Don't be afraid, Madonna
You gotta get 'em a hop
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be afraid, Madonna
You gotta get 'em a hop
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tockSometimes I think what I need is a you intervention
And you know I can tell that you like it and that it's good
By the way that you move
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
But if I die tonight at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how about you?If you want it, you've already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real, just
Say the word and I'mma give you what you wantTime is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy, then grab a girl
Time is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world
No hesitating
We only got four minutes, huh, four minutesSo keep it up, keep it up
Don't be afraid, Madonna
You gotta get 'em a hop
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be afraid, Madonna
You gotta get 'em a hop
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tockBreakdown
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
I've only got four minutes to save the world
