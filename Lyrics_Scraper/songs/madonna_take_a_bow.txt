Take a bow
The night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low the curtains down
There's no one here
(there's no one here)
(there's no one in the crowd)Say your lines but do you feel them
Do you mean what you say?
When there's no one around
(no one around)
Watching you watching me
One lonely star
(one lonely star)
(you don't know who you are)I've always been in love with you
(always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true
(you know it's true)
You took my love for granted
Why oh, why?
This show is over say goodbye
Say goodbye (bye-bye)
Say goodbyeMake them laugh it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart
(breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile
All the world loves a clown
(just make 'em smile)
(the whole world loves a clown)Wish you well I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
(role that you played)
No more masquerade
You're one lonely star
(one lonely star)
(you don't know who you are)I've always been in love with you
(always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true
(you know it's true)
You took my love for granted
Why oh, why?
This show is over say goodbyeI've always been in love with you
(always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true
(you know it's true)
You took my love for granted
Why oh, why?
This show is over say goodbye
Say goodbye (bye-bye)
Say goodbyeAll the world is a stage
(world is a stage)
And everyone has their part
(has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story go
How was I to know you'd break
You'd break you'd break you'd break
You'd break my heartI've always been in love with you
I've always been in love with you
Guess you've always known
You took my love for granted
Why oh, why?
This show is over say goodbyeI've always been in love with you
(always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true
(you know it's true)
You took my love for granted
Why oh, why?
This show is over say goodbye
Say goodbye (bye-bye)
Say goodbye...Say goodbye...
