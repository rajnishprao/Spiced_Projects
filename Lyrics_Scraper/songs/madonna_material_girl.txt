Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk awayThey can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light, that's right, that's right
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl...
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's alright with me
If they can't raise my interest then IHave to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play, no way, no way
Only boys that save their penniesMake my rainy day
'Cause they are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material worldAnd I am a material girl
...
Living in a material world

Living in a material world
Boys may come and boys may go
And that's alright you seeExperience has made me rich
And now they're after me
'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girlYou know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girlYou know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl...
