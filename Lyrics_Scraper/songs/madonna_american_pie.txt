A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew that if I had my chance
I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a whileDid you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so
Now do you believe in rock 'n roll
And can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slowWell I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm 'n bluesI was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'Bye bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', "This will be the day that I die,
This will be the day that I die."I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
Well I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't playWell now in the streets the children screamed (the children screamed)
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed (the poets dreamed)
But not a word was spoken (not a word was spoken)
The church bells all were brokenAnd the three men I admire the most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
We start singin'Bye bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', "This will be the day that I die,
This will be the day that I die."Bye bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', "This will be the day that I die,
This will be the day that I die."We started singin'
We started singin'
We started singin'
We started singin'
