A new argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be denied
There is only one man who can lead any workers' regime
He lives for your problems, he shares your ideals and your dream
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?
A new argentina, the workers' battle song
A new argentina, the voice of the people
Rings out loud and long
Now I am a worker, I've suffered the way that you do
I've been unemployed, and I've starved and I've hated it too
But I found my salvation in peron, may the nation
Let him save them as he saved me
A new argentina, a new age about to begin
A new argentina, we face the world together
And no dissent within
There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead
I can see us many miles away, inactive
Sipping cocktails on a terrace, taking breakfast in bed
Sleeping easy, doing nothing, it's attractive
Don't think I don't think like you
I often get those nightmares too
They always take some swallowing
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum
If it's you that you are following
Don't close doors, keep an escape clause
Because we might lose the big apple
But would I have done what I did
If I hadn't thought, if I hadn't known
We would take the country
Peron has resigned from the army and this we avow
The descamisados are those he is marching with now
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?
A new argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be, and must not be denied
