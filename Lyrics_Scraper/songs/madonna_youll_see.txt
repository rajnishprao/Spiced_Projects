You think that I can't live
Without your love, you'll see
You think I can't go on another dayYou think I have nothing
Without you by my side
You'll see, somehow, somewayYou think that I can't
Never laugh again, you'll see
You think that you've
Destroyed my faith in loveYou think after all you've done
I'll never find my way back home
You'll see, somehow, somedayAll by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay aliveAll on my own
I don't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll seeYou think that you are strong
But you are weak, you'll see
It takes more strength to cry
Admit defeatI have truth on my side
You only have deceit
You'll see, somehow, somedayAll by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive
I'll stand on my own
I won't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see
You'll see
You'll see
You'll see
