Swaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become oneI see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is thatI'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for youTrying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at allSlowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll seeI'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kissBecause I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for youCrazy for you
It's all brand new
I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
I'm crazy, crazy for you
It's all brand new
I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
Yeah I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you baby
I'm crazy for you
I'm crazy for you
