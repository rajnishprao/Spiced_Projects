On this night of a thousand stars
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars
Plays forevermoreIn the glow of those twinkling lights
We shall love through eternity
On this night in a million nights
Fly away with meI never dreamed that a kiss
Could be as sweet as this
But now I know that it can
I used to wander alone
Without a love of my own
I was a desperate manBut all my grief disappeared
And all the sorrow I'd feared
Wasn't there anymore
On that magical day
When you first came my way, mi amorOn this night, on this night
On this night of a thousand stars
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars
Plays forevermore
