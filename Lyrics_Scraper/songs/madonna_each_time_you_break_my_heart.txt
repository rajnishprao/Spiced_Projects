Each time you break my heart
Each time you break my heartI know how it feels to be the talk of the town
I'm not gonna let you go and run around
I need to know that you'll be true to me
'Cause that's the way it's got to beWhy can't you give your promise to me
Is love so blind that you cannot see
I'm trying hard not to walk out the door
Know that I, oh, know that I can't take no moreChorus:Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me criesNo matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you anyway
And if you're so sure that I'm not your kind
How come you can't just walk awayIn the beginning we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on(chorus)Intermediate:I see the look in your eyes
I know you're hurting inside
Let me try
To make you love me again
I'll say that I knew you when
You were mine
You were mineEach time, oh, yeahIn the beginning we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on(intermediate)(chorus)Each time you break my heart again
Well I can say I knew you when [each time]
You were mineBreak my heart
Don't break my heart
(repeat and fade)
