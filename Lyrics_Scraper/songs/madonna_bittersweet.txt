In my hallucination
I saw my beloved's flower garden
In my vertigo, in my dizziness
In my drunken haze
Whirling and dancing like a spinning wheelI saw myself as the source of existence
I was there in the beginning
And I was the spirit of love
Now I am sober
There is only the hangover
And the memory of love
And only the sorrowI yearn for happiness
I ask for help
I want mercy
And my love says:Look at me and hear me
Because I am here
Just for thatI am your moon and your moonlight too
I am your flower garden and your water too
I have come all this way, eager for you
Without shoes or shawlI want you to laugh
To kill all your worries
To love you
To nourish youOh sweet bitterness
I will soothe you and heal you
I will bring you roses
I, too, have been covered with thorns
