Papa I know you're going to be upset
I was always your little girl
You should know by now
I'm not a babyYou always taught me right from wrong
I need your help daddy please be strong
I may be young at heart but I know what I'm sayingThe one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess and I don't mean maybe
PleasePapa don't preach
I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
I'm keeping my baby, mmm

We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrificeBut my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young

What I need right now is some good advice
