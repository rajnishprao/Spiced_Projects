Como puede ser verdadLast night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday not far awayTropical (ah-ah) the island breeze
All of nature (ah-ah-ah-ah) wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when (ah-ah) the samba played
The sun (ah-ah-ah-ah) would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullabyI fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last they went so fastTropical (ah-ah) the island breeze
All of nature (ah-ah-ah-ah) wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when (ah-ah) the samba played
The sun (ah-ah-ah-ah) would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullabyI want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta
You can watch them go by
Beautiful faces no cares in this world
Where girl loves a boy and a boy... loves a girlLast night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday not far awayTropical (ah-ah) the island breeze
All of nature (ah-ah-ah-ah) wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when (ah-ah) the samba played
The sun (ah-ah-ah-ah) would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullaby
(pa-pa-pa-pa)
Tropical (ah-ah) the island breeze
All of nature (ah-ah-ah-ah) wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when (ah-ah) the samba played
The sun (ah-ah-ah-ah) would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullaby(la-la-la-la-la)Te dijo te amo(la-la-la-la-la)El dijo que te ama
(pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
(ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
La Isla Bonita
(ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
