My name is dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'll be your loved one darling
Turn off the light
I'll be your sorceress, your heart's magician
I'm not a witch, I'm a love technicianI'll be a guiding light in your darkest hour
I'm gonna change your life, I'm like a poison flowerGive it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body (repeat twice)
All over me (repeat 3 times)We could use the cage
I've got a lot of rope
I'm not full of rage
I'm full of hope
This is not a crime and you're not on trial
Bend over baby, I'm gonna make you smileLight the candles, 'til they're nice and soft
And when they start to drip, I'm gonna get you offGive it up, do as I say
