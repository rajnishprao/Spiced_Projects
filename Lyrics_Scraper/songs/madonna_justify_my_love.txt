Y-e-a-h...
I wanna kiss you in Paris
I wanna hold your hand in Rome
I wanna run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train cross country
You put this in me
So now what?
So now what?
Wanting needing waiting
For you to justify my love
(my love) Hoping
(my love) Praying
For you to justify my love
(moaning)
Okay
I want to know you
Not like that
I don't wanna be your mother
I don't wanna be your sister either
I just wanna be your lover
I wanna have your baby
Kiss me that's right kiss me
Wanting needing waiting
For you to justify my love
(my love) Yearning
(my love) Burning
For you to justify my love
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Talk to me
Tell me your dreams
Am I in them?
Tell me your fears
Are you scared?
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly
Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend on the permission of another
Love me that's right love me
I wanna be your baby
M-m-m-m... y-e-a-h...
Wanting needing waiting
For you to justify my love
(my love) I'm open
(my love) Ready
For you to justify my love
(my love) To justify my love
(my love) Wanting to justify
(for you to justify my love)
Waiting (my love) justify my love
(my love) Praying to justify
(for you to justify my love)
To justify my love
I'm open to justify my love
(my love my love)
