Just listen to that, the voice of Argentina
We are adored, we are loved
Statesmanship is more than entertaining peasants
We shall see little manEvita Peron, La Santa Peronista
Evita Peron, La Santa Peronista
Evita Peron, La Santa PeronistaEvita Peron, La Santa Peronista
Evita Peron, La Santa Peronista
Evita Peron, La Santa PeronistaI am only a simple woman
Who lives to serve Peron in his noble crusade to rescue his people
I was once as you are now and I promise you this
We will take the riches from the obligarchs
Only for you, for all of youAnd one day, you too will inherit these treasures
Descamisados, mis companeros
When they fire those cannons, when the crowds sing of glory
It is not just for Peron, but for all of us, for all of usThings have reached a pretty pass
When someone pretty lower-class
Can be respected and admiredBut our privileged class is dead
Look who they are calling for now
