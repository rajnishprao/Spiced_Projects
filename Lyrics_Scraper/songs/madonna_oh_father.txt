It's funny that way, you can get used
To the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved meYou can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I wouldYou can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myselfSeems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father, I have sinnedYou can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I wouldYou can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myselfOh Father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running awayOh Father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running awayMaybe someday
When I look back I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you tooYou can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I wouldYou can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so goodYou can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I wouldYou can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself
