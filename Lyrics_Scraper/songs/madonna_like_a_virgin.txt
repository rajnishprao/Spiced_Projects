I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat incompleteI'd been had I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah you made me feel shiny and new...Hey

Touched for the very first time
Like a v-i-r-g-i-n
When your heart beats next to mineGonna give you all my love boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you 'cause only love can lastYou're so fine and you're mine

Oh, your love thawed out

'Cause you made me feel
